        <h1>Swimming</h1>
        <p>Growing up i had the chance to travel around Europe racing for both Ireland and munster.</p>
        <p>I had the opportunity to visit Portugal, Spain, Scotland, England and Germany.</p>
      
        <h2>Information</h2>
                <p>Swimming thought me valuable lessons about discipline, motivation and hard work. Over my many years swimming, a regular week would consist of about 20 hours a week in the pool and about 3-4 hours lifting weights</p>
                <p>My favourite stroke is been butterfly. However, I have always been better at backcrawl.</p>
